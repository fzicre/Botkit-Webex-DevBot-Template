<blockquote class="info"><h1>Securing our bot</h1></blockquote>

As we know security is very important and in this document we will talk about some ways to make your bot more secure.

<blockquote class="success"><h3>Websockets vs Webhooks</h3></blockquote>

Why this template uses websockets and not webhooks?
For practical reasons, To run this bot we would need a service like NGROK, which basically what it does is make available a public Internet-facing URL of the folder where you have the bot on your server/pc. Or hire a hosting service.
It can be practical while you are developing the bot, but what happens when we have to upload it to a server in our company?
the situation becomes more complex and more difficult to work the security environment.
Also if you are behind a Firewall maybe you have to work around that too.

<blockquote class="danger"><h3>Making my bot private</h3></blockquote>

With this template you will be able to decide if you want to have this bot restricted to external users or if just a couple of users will be able to access it.
For this case we are going to use middleware, which is already added in the bot.js code in the bot root folder.
let's take a look:

<h3>bot.js</h3>

    // In this example we are only allowing access to two users by email.

     controller.middleware.ingest.use(async (bot, message, next) => {
     if (message.type === 'self_message' || message.type === 'attachmentActions' || message.type === 'messages.deleted') {
      next();
      return;
    }

     const { PERMITTED_EMAIL1 } = process.env;
     const { PERMITTED_EMAIL2 } = process.env;
     const emailDomain = message.personEmail;

     if (emailDomain === PERMITTED_EMAIL1  || emailDomain === PERMITTED_EMAIL2){
     next(); 
     return;
     }

      console.log('MESSAGE FROM EXTERNAL USER');
      message.type = 'external_user_message'; 

    next();
    });

     //Returns an access denied
     controller.on('external_user_message', async (bot, message) => {
     const text = 'I am sorry, you do not have access to this resource or you performed an illegal action';
     await bot.reply(message, text);
    });

Remember that the emails must be indicated in the .env file, you can also play with this option and allow only domains

<h3>.ENV</h3>

    PERMITTED_EMAIL1=

    PERMITTED_EMAIL1=
