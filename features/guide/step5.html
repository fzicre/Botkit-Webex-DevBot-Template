<h3>The Bot can hear you!!</h3>

Say Hi to the bot. Did you see what happened?


<h3>Ok, but how it works?</h3>



Botkit has a special event handler called hears() that makes it easy to configure your bot to listen for this type of trigger.
Each call to controller.hears() sets up a separate set of patterns to listen for. Developers may specify a single pattern to match, or an array of patterns. By default, Botkit treats these patterns as regular expressions to be evaluated against the message.text field in incoming messages.

Let's take a look at one of the examples:

                   controller.hears( [ 'hi','hello','howdy','hey','aloha','hola','bonjour','oi','hola','buenos dias','buenas tardes','buenas','alo' ], 'message,direct_message', async ( bot,message ) => {

That's the line of code from the "Hello Template", which is one of the features. The controller hears "hi or Hello", then responds as a message with the call bot.reply in this next line:

                   await bot.reply( message, `Hello there!: Im ${ controller.adapter.identity.displayName }` );

In addition to the array of patterns, hears() also receives as an argument one or more event types. Only events of the type listed will be evaluated.
It is important to note that Botkit will stop processing handlers when the first hears() trigger is matched. 

that's it!, you can modify this example/template, make the bot hear and answer whatever you want.
