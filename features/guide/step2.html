<h3>Bot access token</h3>
   
I assume at this point that you already have a webex account.
But if you don't, you can go to https://www.webex.com and press the "Sign Up, It's free" button to get one.

The next step is going to https://developer.webex.com , Log In with your account, then click into your Avatar, "My Webex Apps", then click in "Create a New App".
Once there, "Create a Bot".
Complete the following: "Bot Name", "Bot username", select an "Icon or upload an image" (it must be 512x512px JPEG or PNG) and provide details about what your bot does.

Then "Add bot". After that you will be presented with some information about the bot, including the Access Token. Copy or write down the access token.



Next step, ask me about: <blockquote class="info"><h3>step3</h3></blockquote>
