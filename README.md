# botkit-webex-devhelpbot

The purpose of this bot is to provide help in developing your first conversational bot in Webex. 
Among its functions the bot can show you the code of each example, provide you guides and the necessary steps to build the bot that best suits your needs.
It is aimed at users with little or no knowledge at all of development.

This bot uses the Botkit framework, a well-tested framework and very popular across platforms.


This project is based on the DevNet [botkit-template](https://www.github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-template).


## Websockets vs. Webhooks


























- `emoji.js`- Converts emoji tags into unicode characters and returns the "emojified" phrase

- `events.js` - Retrieve/display DevNet event details from an HTTP REST API providing JSON data

- `roomid-phantom.js` - Helpful utility bot; when added to a room, it creates a separate space with the requestor and outputs the roomId of the original room

- `roomkit.js` - Interact with a Cisco room device via xAPI/jsxapi.  Query the device's 'PeopleCount' function, or execute an ad hoc 'xStatus' CLI command

- `survey.js` - Implements a basic survey, posting survey data into a cloud service (i.e. Webex Teams) via an external REST API 

## Websockets vs. Webhooks

Most Botkit features can be implemented by using the Webex Teams JS SDK websockets functionality, which establishes a persistent connection to the Webex Teams cloud for outbound and inbound messages/events.

Webex Teams also supports traditional HTTP webhooks for messages/events, which requires that your bot be accessible via a publically reachable URL.  A public URL is also needed if your bot will be serving any web pages/files, e.g. images associated with the cards and buttons feature or the health check URL.

- If you don't need to serve buttons and cards images, you can set the environment variable `WEBSOCKET_EVENTS=True` and avoid the need for a public URL
- If you are implementing buttons & cards, you will need a public URL (e. g. by using a service like Ngrok, or hosting your bot in the cloud) - configure this via the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable 

## How to run (local machine)

Assuming you plan to us [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to give your bot a publically available URL (optional, see above), you can run this template in a jiffy:

1. Clone this repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-webex-samples.git

    cd botkit-webex-samples
    ```

1. Install the Node.js dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

1. Create a Webex Teams bot account at ['Webex for Developers'](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/bot), and note/save your bot's access token

1. Launch Ngrok to expose port 3000 of your local machine to the internet:

    ```sh
    ngrok http 3000
    ```

    Note/save the 'Forwarding' HTTPS address that ngrok generates

1. Rename the `env.example` file to `.env`, then edit to configure the settings and info for your bot.  Individual features included in this project may need specific configurations in `.env` (see the comments at the top of each feature `.js` file for details.)

    >Note: you can also specify any of these settings via environment variables (which will take precedent over any settings configured in the `.env` file)...often preferred in production environments

    To successfully run all of the sample features, you'll need to specify at minimum a `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Webex Teams bot access token), and either a `PUBLIC_URL` or enable `WEBSOCKET_EVENTS`.

    >Note: If running on Glitch.me or Heroku (with [Dyno Metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) enbaled), the `PUBLIC_URL` will be auto-configured

    Additional values in the `.env` file (like `OWNER` and `CODE`) are used to populate the healthcheck URL meta-data.

    Be sure to save the `.env` file!

1. You're ready to run your bot:

    ```sh
    node bot.js
    ```

## Quick start on Glitch.me

* Click [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/CiscoDevNet/botkit-template)

* Open the `.env` file, then uncomment the `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable and paste in your bot's access token

    **Optional**: enter appropirate info in the "Bot meta info..." section

    >Note that thanks to Glitch `PROJECT_DOMAIN` env variable, you do not need to add a `PUBLIC_URL` variable pointing to your app domain

You bot is all set, responding in 1-1 and 'group' spaces, and sending a welcome message when added to a space!

You can verify the bot is up and running by browsing to its healthcheck URL (i.e. the app domain.)

## Quick start on Heroku

* Create a new project pointing to this repo.

* Open your app settings, view your config variables, and add a `WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable with your bot's access token as value.

* Unless your app is using [Dyno Metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata), you also need to add a PUBLIC_URL variable pointing to your app domain.
