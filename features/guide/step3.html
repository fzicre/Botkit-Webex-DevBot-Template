<h3>.Env File</h3>
   
The first thing we need to do is to edit this ".env" file.

For now we only need to edit this lines:

        WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN=

        WEBSOCKET_EVENTS=True

        PORT=3000



<blockquote class="success">In WEBEX_ACCESS_TOKEN= we need to put the Webex token that we obtained in the developers portal in "step2".</blockquote>

<blockquote class="success">In WEBSOCKET_EVENTS=True , we are going to use websockets instead of webhooks in this example.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="success">In PORT=3000, we can leave this value at this port or whatever port we have available.</blockquote>



Next step, ask me about: <blockquote class="info"><h3>step4</h3></blockquote>
