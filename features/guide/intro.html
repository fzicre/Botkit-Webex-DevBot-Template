<blockquote class="success"><h1>Intro: Building a conversational bot</h1></blockquote>


  <h3>So do you want to build a bot?</h3>

  First of all we must understand what a bot is.
   According to Wikipedia a bot is a software application that runs automated tasks over the Internet, usually with the intent to emulate human activity on the Internet, such as messaging, on a large scale.
   So the first step basically is to think about what type of bot we are going to need.
   In this guide you will learn to set up your own bot using Botkit 4, a well tested framework with a lot of useful features.
   And before we continue, let me give you some ideas for your bot.
 
   * FAQ bot, how can answer the most frequent questions or give detailed information to a user or a space.
   * Helpdesk bot, which can provide an extra channel for user support
   * Health Checker bot for your website/server
   * Automated task for your workgroup
 
 
 
   And the best of all, you will learn by doing. The best way to learn in my opinion.
