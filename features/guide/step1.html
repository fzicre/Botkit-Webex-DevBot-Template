<h3>What you will need to start is this:</h3>
   


* A webex account (if you don't have one, you can create an account for free at: https://www.webex.com/ )
* Download and install Node.Js - https://nodejs.org/en/
* Download the DevBot Template from - https://github.com/fzicre/Botkit-Webex-DevBot-Template.git
* Visual Code Studio - https://code.visualstudio.com/download Optional but recommended. You can use Atom, Sublime or even a notepad to edit the code!.
Ok, now we have everything we need to start.
 
The first thing we are going to need is to install Node.Js, once installed open a node terminal or simply run CMD, locate the folder where your DevBot template is and from there run this command:
