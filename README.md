# Botkit-Webex-DevBot-Template

The purpose of this bot is to provide help in developing your first conversational bot in Webex. 
Among its functions the bot can show you the code of each example, provide you guides and the necessary steps to build the bot that best suits your needs.
It is aimed at users with little or no knowledge at all of development.

This bot uses the Botkit framework, a well-tested framework and very popular across platforms.


This project is based on the DevNet [botkit-template](https://www.github.com/CiscoDevNet/botkit-template).
